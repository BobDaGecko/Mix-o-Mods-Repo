### Config/Misc:  
+ Fixed Woot whitelist/blacklist config (for real this time)
+ Added Blood Magic guide to "default" Akashic tome collection (currently no normal crafting recipe for BM guide)
+ Added tooltips for books included in Akashic tome to guide more people to use the tome if they didn't know about it
+ Fixed OreDict issue on Forestry wood piles (prevented charcoal pits from working)
+ Rice dough decided to get all-up in paper's recipes. Nipped that in the bud.  
+ People really really don't like getting chiseled ice from void resource miners. Fixed this game-breaking bug.
