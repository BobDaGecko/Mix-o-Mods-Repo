Mix o' Mods 1.12
======
This is the official repository and issue-tracker for Mix o' Mods 1.12.2

Mix o’ Mods is a large kitchen soup pack based off of FTB Infinity Evolved and All the Mods 3. It focuses on exploration, magic, and tech. It also has a plethora of cosmetic mods to enhance creative builds. It has no quest structure and is pretty free handed in what the player can do. It is not a relatively hard pack as most configs and recipes have not been tweaked but that also can represent many challenges. It was created by and is maintained by BobDaGecko.
