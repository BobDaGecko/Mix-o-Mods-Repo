## Mix o' Mods 1.12.2
This is the official repository and issue-tracker for Mix o' Mods 1.12.2

Mix oâ€™ Mods is a large kitchen soup pack based off of FTB Infinity Evolved and All the Mods 3. It focuses on exploration, magic, and tech. It also has a plethora of cosmetic mods to enhance creative builds. It has no quest structure and is pretty free handed in what the player can do. It is not a relatively hard pack as most configs and recipes have not been tweaked but that also can represent many challenges. It was created by and is maintained by BobDaGecko.

## Need Help?
Go to the issues section and make sure to enter version number. Also enter all mods that you may of added to the pack and make the issue clear. Don't just say, "My game is broken." Note: You must follow the template unless you are giving a suggestion.

## Known Issues
#### ie: Game crashes on first start up
There are certain issues with pack that I have found. If I have been unable to find a premanant fix they will be listed [here](https://github.com/BobDaGecko/MoM-Repo/issues/2). Any help to fixing these issues will be greatly appreciated.

## System Requirements
This is a large modpack and is rescource demanding. As long you have relatively modern hardware all you will need is a minimum of 16 GB of ram. You will not allocate all 16 gigabytes but it is recommended that you allocate 8 gigabytes and a minimum of six (note: this will cause a notification to pop up warning of performance issues).
